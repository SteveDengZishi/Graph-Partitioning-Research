//  We define convergence to be the case if the improvement in locality is less than 1% compare to the previous iteration
//
//  logic: read from the locality data after each round of BLP and check the improvement of locality whether less than 1%
//  if so, we say BLP converges and we will run a disruptive round from the bash script instead of run disruptive every
//  fixed number of rounds
